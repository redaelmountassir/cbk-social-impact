                The racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionately being affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.
                This is not unique to the recent pandemic as social determinants of health have been evident throughout
                history for a long time.<strong> Discrimination, lack of access of healthcare,
                occupations on the frontlines, and educational, income, and wealth gaps together can put these people at a significantly
                higher risk of being hospitalized or dying.</strong>
