            <h2>Why are there disparities</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Discrimination</b> that exists in the systems meant to protect the health of the citizens such as health care, education, and housing.</li>
                <li>Lack of <b>healthcare</b> due to an inability to access it whether it is because of a lack of transportation, cultural barriers, or etc. Some do not utilize it because of distrust of the system as a result of historical events such as the Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the African American Male.</li>
                <li>The <b>Occupations</b> of many minorities fall in the category of essential work which means more opportunities of being exposed to Covid-19. This is especially true in the health and public service scene where minorities are overrepresented.</li>
                <li><b>Educational, income, and wealth gaps</b> may lead to less stable and lower-paying jobs which do not allow for much flexibility and make sick days difficult.</li>
                <li><b>Housing</b> conditions can make distancing spread prevention challenging. Many minorities live in crowded homes where spread is most successful. In addition to that, the financial crisis caused by the pandemic can result in evictions and homelessness and more sharing of homes for low-income families.</li>

            <h2>The Solution?</h2>
            <p>
                The solution? For most people, you can connect and support others to promote thier social and mental well-being. As for organizations,
                healthcare systems, public health agencies, and etc. they can work together to make Covid-19 resources and healthcare affordable, accessible, 
                and fair for racial and ethnic minorities.
