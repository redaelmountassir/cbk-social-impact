            <p>
                This problem affects racial and ethnic minority groups meaning people of color from an assortment of backgrounds.
                These people share many key attributes that put them at a high risk. Some common contributing factors include work
                on the frontlines, low income, lack of insurance, and chronic health conditions. In fact, <a href = “more.html”>the same issues</a> that make ethnic minority 
                groups contribute to more cases also cause other major illnesses that put them at an increased risk of death
                when contracting Covid-19. </p>

            <h2>How are they affected</h2>
            <p>
                There are some direct obvious results when there is increased exposure to the virus. Those people end up being hospitalized, or in worse cases, dying. 
                However, the mental toll is notable as well. Low-income families cannot afford to lay-off or have sick days and as a result stress can build up and 
                virus exposure increases. On the other hand, many are too afraid to work because minorities make up the majority of health workers. Structural and societal
                factors have many minorities at a strong disadvantage during and after the pandemic.
